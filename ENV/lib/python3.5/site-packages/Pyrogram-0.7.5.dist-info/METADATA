Pyrogram
========

.. code-block:: python

    from pyrogram import Client, Filters

    app = Client("my_account")

**Pyrogram** is a brand new Telegram_ Client Library written from the ground up in Python and C. It can be used for building
custom Telegram applications that interact with the MTProto API as both User and Bot.

Features
--------

-   **Easy to use**: You can easily install Pyrogram using pip and start building your app right away.
-   **High-level**: The low-level details of MTProto are abstracted and automatically handled.
-   **Fast**: Crypto parts are boosted up by TgCrypto_, a high-performance library written in pure C.
-   **Updated** to the latest Telegram API version, currently Layer 81 on top of MTProto 2.0.
-   **Documented**: The Pyrogram API is well documented and resembles the Telegram Bot API.
-   **Full API**, allowing to execute any advanced action an official client is able to do, and more.

Requirements
------------

-   Python 3.4 or higher.
-   A `Telegram API key`_.

Installing
----------

.. code:: shell

    pip3 install pyrogram
